# One parameter conjugate Bayesian analyses

This shiny app allows the user to understand the relationship between prior, likelihood, and posterior in a variety of one parameter conjugate Bayesian models. To get started, click on a model in the navigation bar above.

The distributions in this app include binomial, Poisson, normal (with unknown mean and variance), and exponential. The parameterizations used here agree with those used on the [conjugate prior wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior).
